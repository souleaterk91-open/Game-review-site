# AI AGENT DIRECTIVES & GUIDELINES
# ==========================================
# 1. TEST-DRIVEN APPROACH: Future AI agents MUST use a Test-Driven Approach
#    (TDD) when working on this codebase to reduce errors. Write tests first!
# 2. DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE: Always add to README.md or context.md
#    as needed when making architectural, configuration, or feature changes.
# 3. CODE COMPLETENESS: Never use placeholders. Output fully working code.
