# Product Roadmap: Game Review Site (Pre-Gaming & Post-Gaming)

## Product Vision
A comprehensive game review platform catering to two distinct types of gamers:
1. **Pre-Gamers**: Players looking for spoiler-free reviews, ratings, and buying advice before purchasing or starting a game.
2. **Post-Gamers**: Players who have completed the game and seek deep dives, story analysis, "ending explained" content, and a community to discuss the game with via comments.
